Dead Simple Extensions
======================

Extensions are easy to author, install, and configure. The included extensions
address many common needs already. A number of the included extensions are
enabled by default to deliver a full-featured system out of the box.

Pluggable Authentication
========================

Authenticate users: OAuth 2.0, Kerberos, and traditional username/password
logins are all possible. A session cookie-only policy is included, as well as a
policy that does not perform any authentication.

Pluggable Comment Renderer
==========================

Render comments as HTML-escaped text, Markdown-formatted text, or sanitized
HTML. A Markdown renderer and an HTML-escaping renderer are included.

Adaptable to Different JavaScript Widgets
=========================================

Adapt the HTTP API endpoint locations and the format of the API response to
match an existing JavaScript comment widget.

Custom Comment Metadata
=======================

Collect custom metadata fields upon comment submission. Fields may even be
dynamic. Custom metadata can also be added to threads and identities as well.
Collectors for author, email, website, and IP address are included.

Custom Validation Rules
=======================

Validate new custom fields or existing fields with custom rules. A comment
length rule is included.

Moderation and Admin Interface
==============================

Create admin users that can log in to moderate comments and manage threads. By
default, protected with username/password authentication. This is enabled
by an included extension.

Comment Edits and Versioning
============================

Allow users to edit or delete comments. An extension is included to save
previous versions to retain the edit history.

Voting / Likes
==============

Allow users to upvote/downvote (like/dislike) comments. The backend will save
not just the total vote counts, but also which users like which comments. This
is enabled by an included extension.

Notifications

Notify admins via email upon comment submission. XMPP, IRC, and other
notifications methods are also possible through custom
extensions.
